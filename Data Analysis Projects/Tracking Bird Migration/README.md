One fascinating area of research uses GPS to track movements of animals. It is now possible to manufacture a small GPS device that is solar charged, so you don’t need to change batteries and use it to track flight patterns of birds.

The data for this case study comes from the LifeWatch INBO project. Since 1999, the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) studies the postnuptial migration, and mate and site fidelity of large gulls, using observer sightings of colour-ringed individuals. In the framework of the Flemish contributions to the LifeWatch infrastructure, a high-tech sensor network was installed (start June 2013) to better monitor the habitat use and migration patterns of large birds, such as the European Herring Gull (Larus argentatus Pontoppidan). Several data sets have been released as part of this project. We will use a small data set that consists of migration data for three gulls named Eric, Nico, and Sanne

## Aim & Observations

Track the movement of three gulls namely – Eric, Nico & Sanne

The case study is divied into six parts:

1. Visualizing longitude and latitude data of the gulls.
2. Visualize the variation of the speed of the gulls.
3. Visualize the time required by the gulls to cover equal distances over the journey.
4. Visualize the daily mean speed of the gulls.
5. Visualize the daily average altitude gulls fly at.
6. Cartographic view of the journey of the gulls.
